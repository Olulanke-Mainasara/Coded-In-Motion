# 🎬 Coded-in-Motion — Creating Stories Beyond Expectations ✨

Every project begins with a spark.  
Coded-in-Motion is where **technology meets creativity**, weaving code and content into experiences that move.

This repository holds two worlds in harmony:  
a **frontend** that tells the story, and a **Sanity Studio** where those stories are shaped.
